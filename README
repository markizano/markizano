This is a project I started to maintain everything I know how to do in the ZF. I
plan on putting everything I know into this and creating a decent skeleton
framework I can keep around so that I can maintain work that I can simply copy
and paste directly into other ZF-based projects. No application-specific work
will end up in this project unless it's generic enough to be presented as such.
